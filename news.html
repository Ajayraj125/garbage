<h2>How Often Should My Garbage Disposal Be Cleaned?</h2>
<p>Clean your garbage disposal weekly to remove leftover food and residue. This will keep it free of strange odors or plumbing issues.

When you're consistent in maintaining your sink's drain line and monitoring what you put down your garbage disposal, you'll only need to clean it 1-2 times per month. Sounds nice, right?</p>
<h2>Persistent odors</h2>
<p>Food particles can cause bacteria build-up, causing bad smells. Cleaning thoroughly and often will help eliminate odors.</p>
<h2>Poor performance</h2>
<p>If the power mechanism is non-functioning, there may be issues that can trip the circuit breaker or overheat the system. Take a look at your disposal model and get in touch with a team of local plumbers that can help.</p>
<h2>Steps to Safely Clean Your Garbage Disposal</h2>
<p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to successfully clean your garbage disposal.</p>
<h3>Turn Off The Power</h3>
<p>The first step to properly clean a garbage disposal is to power it down. Completely disconnecting it from the power source ensures your safety and helps clean it thoroughly.

Sometimes, you may need to shut down the power breaker box or unplug any third-party items from the outlet. Before beginning any maintenance, make sure there is no electricity being supplied to the plumbing systems.</p>

<h3>Remove The Trapped Particles</h3>
<p>Access a flashlight and aim it down the drain. This will let you see any trapped food particles. There may be food or objects that are clogging the grinding chamber.

If you find any trapped particles or objects, use a set of long-nosed pliers or tongs. Basically, any tool that will reach deep into the drain will work. You can use your hands to remove obstructions only if it's absolutely necessary.

If you choose to use your hands, be sure you wear gloves. This will help maintain a sanitary disinfecting process. While wearing gloves, carefully reach around the blades of the grinding chamber. Run the water and allow it to pour over the drain stopper. This will wash away any residue.

Remove all the small pieces from the piping and leave no debris behind for disposal.</p>
<h3>Don't Grind Certain Foods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Egg shells</li>

<li>Coffee grounds</li>

<li>Plastic</li>

<li>Larger animal bones</li>

<li>Starchy or sticky foods</li>

<li>Fibrous vegetables</li>

<li>Certain types of grease</li>
</ul>

<p>These items can create an obstructed disposal, damaging the motor and cause the garbage disposal to leak. Once you clean the blades and the grinding chamber, you'll want to rinse the splash guard.</p>
